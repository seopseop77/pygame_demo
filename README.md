# Pygame Platformer Demo

This repository contains a simple Mario-style side scrolling platformer built with Pygame.
All game objects are rendered using basic colored rectangles so no image assets
are required.

## Running

```
python3 project/main.py
```

Press `E` during the game to open the map editor. Use `1`-`5` to change tiles, left click to place, right click to erase, `S` to save, and `ESC` to return to the game.
